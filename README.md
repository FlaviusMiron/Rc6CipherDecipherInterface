# Rc6CypherDecypherInterface
Graphical user interface for the RC6 cipher. The cipher uses a block size of 16 characters (4 * 4 bytes), a key size of 16 bytes, and 12 rounds of encryption. The cipher also works for cases where the message exceeds 16 characters in size by padding the message and using Cypher Block Chaining in this case.
