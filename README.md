# Rc6CypherDecypherInterface
Graphical user interface for the RC6 cipher. The cipher uses a block size of 16 characters (4 * 4 bytes), a key size of 16 bytes, and 12 rounds of encryption. The cipher also works for cases where the message exceeds 16 characters in size by padding the message and using Cypher Block Chaining in this case.

Shows the histogram of the plain texts and ciphered message.

Saves the ciphered message in a text file in the same directory, in case it is too big to be displayed in the interface.
